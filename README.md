# Na-Cinemas-API
Customer REST API to display tickets and snack options and an Admin REST API to update tickets and update, add and delete snacks.

Na Cinemas aims to enhance ticket booking and snack ordering for its Mysore theatre. 
Partnering with ABC, the plan involves leveraging Salesforce and CloudHub. 
A Salesforce Theatre app with a "Na" object will store 40 tickets, detailing ticket_id, type, price, number, and booking status. 
Additionally, a "Snacks" object will hold 10 snack varieties with relevant info. 
REST APIs for customers and admins are designed: displaying tickets, arranging by type, status, and snacks info. 
The solution adopts Mulesoft's API Led Connectivity, secured by policies. RAML ensures best practices, while robust error handling and user-friendly logging enhance reliability.
